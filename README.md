## Data files

### Raw data

We generated a small example dataset with 300 travels in 10 days between 3 fake stations ("A", "B" and "C").
The set has been cut into two parts: train (7 days: the first five consecutive days of the ten, plus two not consecutively) and test (3 days).

These are available under the "data/raw" folder.

### Solution files

A "solution file" is the reference, the ground truth, that contains data derived from the
"test" part of the raw data -- the information that has to be predicted by the challenge participants.

The sample solution file for task 1 has been generated by running :

```bash
python python/preproc/compute_solution_1.py data/raw/mini_test.csv data/task1-BRP/mini1-solution.csv
```

### Sample submission files

## Scripts

All scripts are written in Python, and can be found in the "python" folder. (w.i.p.)

Tests can be run with [pytest](http://pytest.org "py.test").
